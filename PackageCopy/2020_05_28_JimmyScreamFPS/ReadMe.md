## Step by step

- Open the scene you want to test
- Go in the prefab folder of the package
- Drag and drop `Canvas Jimmy FPS` if you want 2D FPS with sound
- Drag and drop `Jimmy Audio FPS` if you want just 3D audio debugger
- Configure the Audio Source in the prefab drop to change the sound if needed
- Change the Boundary FPS in `Jimmy Screamer` if you need to caliber the FPS range.
- Click play or build your game
- If you hear the sound of a screaming guy you are under the 60 FPS
- If you hear a bip sound you are under the 40 FPS
- More the game is low in FSP more the sound are high in volume.
